# **THIS IS WHERE WE CAN HELP YOU !!**

```
HelloDocument can help you extend the capabilities of your documents by using 
- Deep Machine Learning technologies, 
- Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
- Natural language Understanding (NLU) and 
- Natural Language Generation (NLG), 
thereby making the extraction easier. 
Organizational documents grow substantially over time making it intractable and hence, 
it’s important we organize them to leverage its full potential. 
We want to leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence without over-complicating 
the entire process and without spending a lot of additional effort. 
You can make a better decision by improving operational efficiency and hence drive better outcomes.

# You upload your documents in our system and the following will happen,
1. Our Machine Learning algorithms pre-read your documents and create a downloadable knowledgebase. You can validate and edit the content.
2. You can ask a question and the machine will get an answer from the documents by understanding your query. We not only give the answer but also show the context. Most of the time users need provenance to make it trustworthy and context serves that purpose.
3. A keyword-based search will fetch the passages that contain the information. You don’t want to open a large document to find the information hiding somewhere.
4. You can view the important information pertinent to a document and download it if needed.
5. You can group together all connected contents from your corpus. This might unravel redundancy in your information content.
6. Based on your search, it will show similar queries that may come from other documents.
7. The knowledgebase can be integrated with your existing chatbot system through our APIs.
8. Dashboard and reporting.

# Deployment
While our preference is to deploy the solution in the cloud, as we are in the process of adding newer features in the system. However, we can still deploy it on-prem provided it meets the infrastructure and computational need.

If needed we can work with you to customize our solution.

# Customization
For delivering better outcome, in case you need any specific customization, our experts will talk with you to understand the need and will propose the necessary steps. This can be done with additional funding.
